We're picking up from where we left off in systems engineering.
Today we're working on ssh private and public key pairs. We're then gonna start working with loops and onditionals in bash scripting. We'll start using the #!/usr/bin/ env bash rather than #!/bin/bash to make our scripts more portable for systems that may not necessarily have the bash binary located in the bin, but rather somewhere else in the PATH.
We're also gonna start working with Shellcheck, which will be our linter for shell scripts going forward.
